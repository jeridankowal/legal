<li><b>Term, Suspension and Termination Term of Agreement. This Agreement commences on the date Customer first accepts it and continues until all subscriptions hereunder have expired or have been terminated. Term of Purchased Subscriptions. The term of each subscription shall be as specified in the applicable Order Form or Online Purchase Portal. Except as otherwise specified in an Order Form or Online Purchase Portal, subscriptions will automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring subscription term or one year (whichever is shorter), unless either party gives the other written notice (email acceptable) at least 30 days before the end of the relevant subscription term. Except as expressly provided in the applicable Order Form or Online Purchase Portal, renewal of promotional or one-time priced subscriptions will be at Company’s applicable list price in effect at the time of the applicable renewal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any renewal in which subscription volume or subscription length for any Services has decreased from the prior term will result in re-pricing at renewal without regard to the prior term’s per-unit pricing. Suspension. If any charge owing by Customer under this or any other agreement for services is 30 days or more overdue, (or 10 or more days overdue in the case of amounts Customer has authorized Company to charge to Customer’s credit card), Company may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee obligations under such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until such amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for Customers paying by credit card or direct debit whose payment has been declined, Company will give Customer at least 10 days’ prior notice that its account is overdue, in accordance with the “Notice” section below for billing notices, before suspending services to Customer. Company may suspend or terminate the Services upon any breach of the sections “Customer Usage and Customer Content” or “Customer Content Representations and Warranties”, or any other use of the Services that in Company’s judgment threatens the security, integrity or availability of Company’s services, or any other use that may create liability for Company or the providers of Third Party Services. Company will use commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances to inform Customer of the suspension or termination and will work with Customer in good faith if Customer attempts to resolve the issue. If usage does not come into compliance with this Agreement and any other applicable terms between Customer and Company, we reserve the right to limit Customer's account or terminate the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, fees will not be tolled during any suspension or termination and no refunds will be given. Termination. A party may terminate this Agreement for cause (i) upon 30 days written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period, or (ii) if the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors. Refund or Payment upon Termination. If this Agreement is terminated by Customer in accordance with the “Termination” section above, Company will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Order Forms after the effective date of termination. If this Agreement is terminated by Company in accordance with the “Termination” section above, Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Order Forms to the extent permitted by applicable law. In no event will termination relieve Customer of its obligation to pay any fees due for the period prior to the effective date of termination. Surviving Provisions.
